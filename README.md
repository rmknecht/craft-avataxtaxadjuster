# AvaTax Tax Adjuster plugin for Craft Commerce

Calculates tax rates with Avalara AvaTax

This plugin is in beta and bugs may be present. Please document any issues you encounter at our [Github Issues](https://github.com/surprisehighway/craft-avataxtaxadjuster/issues) page.


## Installation

To install the AvaTax Tax Adjuster plugin, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `avataxtaxadjuster` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone https://github.com/surprisehighway/craft-avataxtaxadjuster.git avataxtaxadjuster` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3.  -OR- install with Composer via `composer require surprisehighway/avataxtaxadjuster`
4. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
5. The plugin folder should be named `avataxtaxadjuster` for Craft to see it. GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

## Using AvaTax Tax Adjuster

1. Visit `Commerce > Settings > Tax Categories`. A tax category with the handle "avatax" should exist, if not, create one.
2. Visit `Commerce > Settings > Product Types`. For each product type to use tax rates provided by Avalara, select the AvaTax category from the "Available Tax Categories" field.

After completing the installation and configuration, AvaTax will calculate and apply sales tax to all orders with a valid shipping address.

## Refunds

Craft Commerce only supports refunds for completed transactions if the [payment gateway](https://craftcommerce.com/support/which-payment-gateways-do-you-support) supports refunds. If refunds are supported for an order Craft displays a "Refund" button in the orderâ€™s Transaction history. Triggering a refund in this way will void the corresponding AvaTax transaction.

Partial refunds, returns, or any other changes must be done manually via the AvaTax website.

## AvaTax Tax Adjuster Roadmap

Some things to do, and ideas for potential features:

* Enable/Disable tax calculation on a per-product basis.
